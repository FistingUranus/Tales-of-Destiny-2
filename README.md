# Tales of Destiny 2 (PS2)
This project is an attempt at an open-source translation for Tales of Destiny 2 (PS2).
To be clear, this is *not* for Tales of Eternia (PSP) or Tales of Destiny II (PS1).
After starting and handing off an open-source project for [Tales of Destiny Director's Cut](https://github.com/furiousg4m3r/Tales-of-Destiny-DC "Tales of Destiny DC") (PS2), the aim of this project is have tools and resources available to complete a patch for Tales of Destiny 2 (PS2), a "sequel" to the first game.

## Wanted Items
1. Any exisiting tools, source code, repositories, but also available to be open-sourced in this repository
2. PS2 memory card file or save files at as many different save points as possible
3. A TBL file or mapping of Hex to Japanese to start dumping text
4. Base pointer for `SLPS_251.72`
5. Any other advice that can be offered to get all the tools available for patch making
