#ねえ、<Loni>。ラグナ遺跡にレンズを探しに行くのはいいけどさ、バレたら神団をクビにされるんじゃないの？
Hey Loni, it's great that you're going to the Laguna Ruins to search for the Lens and all, but won't the Church fire you if they find out about it?
-----------------------
#なあに、バレなきゃいいのさ。
Eh, it'll be fine as long as they don't find out.
-----------------------
#でも、バレたらどうすんのさ？　やっと騎士になれたって、あれだけ喜んでたのに‥‥。
But what if they do? You were so happy that you finally became a knight, so why take the risk...
-----------------------
#騎士になれば、ルーティさんやおまえらみたいな困ってるヤツらを守れるかと思ってた。でも、実際に守るのは神団の人間ばっかだ‥‥フっ、それなら、いっそクビにでもなったほうが、せいせいするってもんだぜ。
I thought that if I became a knight, I'd be protecting people who needed it like Ms. Rutee and you guys. But in reality, the only people I've been protecting are from the Church...Heh, if that's always gonna be the case, then I'll be more relieved than anything else if they end up giving me the ax.
-----------------------
#そっか。じゃあ、みつかっても安心だね！
Oh, okay. Then you've got nothing to worry about even if they do find you!
-----------------------
#バ～カ！　見つからないなら、それにこしたことはねえんだよ。
That ain't to say that I'll be better off if they do find me though, ya blockhead!
